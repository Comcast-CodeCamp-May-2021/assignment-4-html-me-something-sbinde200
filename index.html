         <!--FinderBinders Motto-->
         <h2>ATTENTION!<br> Metal Detecting is more than just saving history! It is about protecting the environment/animals by removing all trash found, and filling in all holes dug.<br>
            It also is about edcuation, and the willingness to share your passion with others that are interested. Metal detecting for me is a way of life and helps me with my mental health through exposure in nature and the ability to learn about history in a way unlike any other.</h2>

      <p>#COINALERT! 🚨 #FINDERBINDERS #rescues a 1787 #NJCOPPER #Coin 😎🤘 found with a #Garrett #AtPro #detector with a #NelStorm coil on a #farm in #SouthJersey 😁✌ I was SO shocked to find this #NewJerseyCopper ! The detail on it is beautifu!l ⭐ I am SO #honored
         This is a 234 year old #Copper and it is also a #BirthdayCoin because I was born in 87! / Before we standardized on our on monetization each of the original #ThirteenColonies had their own coin. I was told there's up to 140+ different variations of it. 🤔
         
         Some people dont even find this coin in their #lifetime of #metaldetecting I am SO #grateful
         Have you found an NJ copper before? let me know!

         <H2>#2 Native American Axe Head</H2>
      <img src= "images/AXEHEAD.jpg" width = "800" height= "600">
      <p>#ARTIFACTALERT! 🚨#FINDERBINDERS shares a #NativeAmerican #Artifact: Found with some patience and mostly luck 😁✌ Looks like an #AxeHead right? But the other side is also blunt like #Hammerhead as well 🔍🤔 It definitely does not look this formed naturally. Maybe this was used by the #LenniLenape
            the other #artifacts found nearby were from the  #Archaic era. 8500 - 3000 BC So I guess it would be safe to assume this is as well.
            I have not ID the stone yet. I am still in awe that I managed to come across something so Incredible ❤
            Do you like #NativeAmericanArtifacts ?

      <p>#GOLDALEART! 🚨!#FINDERBINDERS rescues what appears to be a little hunk of #Gold ! 😮 And boy is it heavy for such a small piece!
         found with a #Minelab #Equinox800 #metaldetector sporting #snakeskinz wire protection 😎🤘
         Never in a million years would I have ever thought to find gold in a #farmfield 🙌 Had an hour to kill so I blasted out to a permission property that I have been to many times.
         Was always told no matter how hard you try a #farm field is never hunted out. 👍Rang in as a 14/15 on the Nox.
         The small 6" #coil really showed its worth today! I was greeted at the end of the day with a #beautiful #golden #sunset 🙌 The #metaldetecting #gods have smiled upon me today and I'm and forever #grateful
